# Gigabit Transceiver
using gigabit transceiver phy of ultrascale+ FPGA to handle high speed data converter or FPGA to FPGA communication

The Aurora MAC project use ultrascale + FPGA gigabit transceiver as PHY and Aurora IP from Xilinx as MAC to handle AXI4 bus data transfer. It allows Microblaze to transfer and receiver AXI4 data from other FPGA.
